The MainActivity.kt code for the White Noise app was generated initially 
by perplexity.ai in response to this statement:
"Provide code for an Android app written in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose to play white noise". 
The initial code did not run, and was corrected using Gemini within Android Studio. 
Gemini within Android Studio was then used to generate additional code to 
add a volume control slider and an audio looping switch.
All of the code for MainActivity.kt for this app was generated by AI.
